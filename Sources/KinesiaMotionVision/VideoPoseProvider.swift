/// Poses from a video file, with the same Vision body pose as the live camera.

/// - Runs on the device that has the file: nothing is uploaded.
/// - Reads iPhone videos in any orientation (it follows the track's rotation).
/// - `mirrored`: pass `true` when the video shows the patient as a mirror does (a selfie
///   recording that kept the preview's flip). Sides are then swapped to the patient's real ones.
/// - Without `realTime`, frames go out as fast as Vision reads them: good for tests and analysis.
/// - Use `readAll()` to get every pose at once, for example to build a `RecordedPoseProvider`.
