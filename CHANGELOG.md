# Changelog

## 0.2.0 · 2026-10-24

- `VideoPoseProvider` (KinesiaMotionVision): poses from a video file with the same Vision body pose
  as the live camera, on iOS and macOS. `readAll()` returns every pose at once.
- `VisionPoseProvider` and `VideoPoseProvider` share the Vision → `Pose` conversion.

## 0.1.0 · 2026-10-24

First stable release, used by the Kinesia patient app.

### Measurement
- `Pose`, `Joint` and `BodySide`, with per-joint confidence and the camera image size.
- `Measure` and `Geometry`: joint angles from three landmarks, and segment angles against the vertical.
- `LandmarkRef` with JSON support, so exercises can be described as data.

### Exercises
- `ExerciseDefinition` and `FormRule`: a rep with a compensation doesn't count.
- `RepEngine` with hysteresis, the peak of each rep and form checking.
- Hold exercises: a rep counts once the position is held and steady.
- `ExerciseLibrary`: elbow flexion, knee flexion (standing and seated), shoulder flexion and abduction,
  hip flexion and abduction, ankle dorsiflexion (lunge) and neck side bend.

### Sessions
- `MotionSession` with snapshots, events, visibility and the first measurement (baseline).
- Measurement quality: setup check before starting, per-rep metrics and confidence.

### Input
- `PoseProvider` and `RecordedPoseProvider` for tests and replays.
- `KinesiaMotionVision`: `VisionPoseProvider` on Apple Vision, mirroring the selfie camera.

### Notes
- Renamed from KinetiaMotion to KinesiaMotion in 0.1.0-alpha.6.
- Angle accuracy against a goniometer (target ±5°) has not been validated yet; that happens in the pilot.
